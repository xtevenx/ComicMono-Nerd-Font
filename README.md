ComicMono Nerd Font
===================
This is a patched Nerd Font and monospacified version of [Comic Shanns][2].

Version 1
--------
Version 1 is just a patched version of dinth's [comic-mono-font][1], which is based on the first
version of Comic Shanns. It has a couple issues such as certain tall glyphs clipping from above.
- [ComicMonoNF-Regular.ttf][3]
- [ComicMonoNF-Bold.ttf][4]

Version 2
---------
Version 2 was monospacified and patched directly from the second version of Comic Shanns. The
clipping issues seem to be gone, but the font is also more spaced out and it personally feels less
characterful than the first version.
- [ComicMonoNerdFont-Regular.ttf][5]
- [ComicMonoNerdFont-Bold.ttf][6]

"Official" version
------------------
The maintainers of Nerd Fonts have patched their own version which can be found [here][7]! This is
based on Rodrigodd's [comic-shanns-mono][8], another monospaced version of Comic Shanns. It looks
high quality, and is even more spaced out than the Version 2 in this repository.
